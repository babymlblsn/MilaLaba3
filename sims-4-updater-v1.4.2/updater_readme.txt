Linux and Mac players - read the appropriate section at the end of this post.

=======================================================================================

Sims 4 Updater is a tool for updating/repairing your cracked game
and downloading new DLCs.

If you have a legit game you can still use it to download DLCs and
to add a cracked exe to your game. If you decide to play the game
from a cracked exe - make sure to update it after each game update.

To use Sims 4 Updater you need to browse for your game installation
folder and click the "Update" button. In a lot of cases Updater
automatically selects the right folder. If the Updater detects certain files
it will ask if that's your legit game. Answer thruthfully!
Finally it asks which DLCs you want to install. If that window doesn't
show up - that means you already have all DLCs.

Sims 4 Updater uses a mix of incremental patches and full files
to ensure the download is as small as possible.

FAQ:

    Q: Do I need a VPN? Does Sims 4 Updater use torrents?
    A: No. Updater uses HTTPS downloads, so you don't need a VPN. Your ISP can't
       see what you're downloading, only that you connected to some server.
       Use a VPN only when you have download issues (see below).

    Q: I get download or metadata errors, what should I do?
    A: Disable your firewall. If that doesn't help - use a VPN.
       With a VPN the Updater will try downloading from a different server.
       If you already use a VPN - try a different one.
       If using a VPN doesn't help - try changing the VPN server/country.
       If that still doesn't help - make sure you are connected to a VPN server.
       Simply installing a VPN and opening it is usually not enough,
       you need to click a button to connect.

       Browser VPNs will not work! If you connect to a VPN in your browser
       this will not work! Download a normal VPN.

       Recommended VPNs:
           Proton VPN (free version doesn't let you select a server)
           Windscribe VPN (10GB per month for free)
           Hide.me VPN (10GB per month for free)
           NordVPN (paid but has a free trial)
           Mullvad VPN (paid)

       If it doesn't work or is too slow - download the files manually:

       If the Updater can't auto-update, download the newest version yourself:
       ( see the Website and CS RIN links at the top of this file )
       If you can't update the game - first download all the patches
       between your current game version and the newest one:
       ( https://rentry.co/sims-4-updater-manual )
       Then download my newest crack (no-origin-fix-<game version>-ANADIUS.rar):
       ( https://rentry.co/the-sims-4-crack-only )
       And finally if you want to install DLCs grab them from:
       ( https://rentry.co/the-sims-4-dlc-only-1 )
       Put all downloaded files in the same folder as Sims 4 Updater and run it.

    Q: I get other error messages or the solutions above didn't help, what should I do?
    A: Disable your anti-virus.
       If that doesn't help - reset file permissions (see question below).
       If that doesn't help - move the folder with Updater to a different place.
       I recommend putting it at the top of the drive with your game, like
       "C:\Sims 4 Updater" or "D:\Sims 4 Updater", etc.
       If you don't know what that means - just keep it in your Downloads folder.

       If moving the Updater doesn't help - create a copy of it. Right click
       on the folder, "Copy", then right click on empty space and "Paste".
       Delete the original folder, keep the copied one.
       If you get copy errors - skip the affected files.

       If that doesn't help - do the same with your game. Make a copy, delete
       the original folder, and rename the copied folder to original name.
       
       If that doesn't help - delete "updater_tmp" folder.

    Q: Error message tells me to reset file permissions, how do I do it?
    A: Download this file
       ( https://anadius.su/attachments/reset-folder-permissions.bat )
       ( https://anadius.github.io/sims-4-tools/files/reset-folder-permissions.bat )
       Right click on it, run as administrator.

    Q: Why is the download speed slow?
    A: Because it uses free download servers. Read the answer to the second question.

    Q: Updater doesn't run, I get error messages, what should I do?
    A: Sims 4 Updater is written in Python 3.10 and they dropped Windows 7
       support in 3.9. So if you have Windows 7 - update it to 8 or newer.
       And make sure you have VC Redist 2015-2022 x64
       ( https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads )
       installed and that your anti-virus doesn't block the Updater.
       There's a hack to make it run on Windows 7 but don't ask me for help with it.
       ( https://github.com/nalexandru/api-ms-win-core-path-HACK )

    Q: My anti-virus says Updater is a virus, should I be concerned?
    A: Sims 4 Updater is written in Python and turned into exe with
       PyInstaller. It is a common issue that some anti-viruses mark it as
       a virus because of how it's made instead of checking what it does.
       ( https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/issues/6754 )
       There's a source code audit by administrator of CS RIN forum posted
       in the second post of Sims 4 Updater thread.
       ( https://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?p=2025856#p2025856 )
       I've been making stuff for The Sims 4 since 2018:
       ( https://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?p=1780388#p1780388 )
       If you don't trust the Updater - don't use any other of my tools either.
       Online crack that most repackers use is also made by me. :)

    Q: Can I use the Updater without internet connection?
    A: No, but you can use the Patcher. It uses the same patch, crack and DLC files
       as the Updater (see links in the second question). You can get it from here:
       ( https://github.com/anadius/patcher/releases/latest/download/patcher_and_patch_maker.7z )
       Extract the 7z archive with 7-zip or WinRAR. patcher.exe is what you want to use.

    Q: How can I uninstall DLCs I no longer want?
    A: Sims 4 Updater adds DLC toggler (for disabling without uninstalling)
       and DLC uninstaller to the folder you selected.

       Open Sims 4 Updater and read the path shown below
       "Select the folder with your The Sims 4 game".
       That's where your game is and that's where you can find those tools.

    Q: How can I change the game language?
    A: Sims 4 Updater adds language changer to the folder you selected.
       See answer above for more information.

    Q: How can I uninstall the game?
    A: Sims 4 Updater doesn't create any uninstaller.
       Simply delete the folder you selected in the Updater.

    Q: Is the new update/DLC added to the Updater?
    A: Check out my Discord or a couple of last pages from The Sims 4 thread:
       ( https://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=65003 )
       I post the news about the Updater there.

    Q: Can you install the whole game with the Updater?
    A: Yes, but I don't recommend it. Use a repack from the second post of
       The Sims 4 thread instead:
       ( https://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?p=930236#p930236 )

    Q: I updated the game but a new DLC is not installed, why?
    A: There are 3 possible reasons:
       1. That DLC isn't out yet. The Sims 4 always gets an update 2-5 days
          before the DLC comes out. The DLC may appear unlocked on the main
          menu screen but if it's not out yet then I can't do anything about
          it, I'm not a time traveller.
       2. You didn't check that DLC in the "Install DLCs" window.
       3. You use DLC Unlocker and didn't read what to do when we get a new DLC.

    Q: I have problems with starting/playing the game, where can I get help?
    A: Make sure you read the troubleshooting guide. You can find it on my website:
       ( https://anadius.su/sims-4-troubleshooting-guide )
       It's also posted on Reddit and in the first post of The Sims 4 thread on CS RIN:
       ( https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackSupport/comments/eskpgu/the_sims_4_troubleshooting_guide/ )
       ( https://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?p=930232#p930232 )
       If you still have problems you can ask in The Sims 4 thread or on my Discord.

    Q: Can I just download DLCs without updating my game?
    A: Yes, create a text file and rename it to "no game update". Keep in mind
       that new DLCs need a new game version. So if you can't see a DLC icon on
       the main menu screen - you won't be able to use it.

    Q: Can I change the font in Updater?
    A: Yes. Set environmental variables:
       SIMS_4_UPDATER_FONT - for font name
       SIMS_4_UPDATER_FONT_SIZE - for font size

        Information for Linux players

The easiest way to run the Updater is by using Lutris. You can also add it yourself
on Steam or run directly through Wine.

If Updater crashes - make sure you're running it through Wine version 8.13 or newer,
or Proton version 8.0-5 or newer.

If you have a legit game through Steam - Updater should automatically detect the
correct path. Then it will ask if that's your legit game - answer "yes". Updater
will leave the legit exe untouched in "Game/Bin" folder and will put a cracked one
in "Game-cracked/Bin". You can play that cracked game (add it on Lutris or Steam)
or you can use a DLC Unlocker, as the Updater says.
If you have a cracked game - you will have to select the main installation folder
yourself. It should be somewhere inside your Wine prefix.

When running the Updater your root directory is available as a Z: drive.
When browsing for folder you access it by opening "My Computer".

=======================================================================================

        Information for Mac players

The easiest way to run the Updater is by downloading the Wineskin wrapper.
You can also make it yourself or run the Updater through Wine/CrossOver.

If Updater crashes - redownload the Updater using the links I provided for Mac users.

Updater will try to automatically detect where your game is. If it doesn't - select
The Sims 4 app. It should automatically detect the correct path to use:
If you have a legit game - Updater will select the correct "The Sims 4 Packs" folder.
And it will download DLC files only.
If you have a cracked game (Windows version running through Wineskin wrapper) - Updater
will select the correct path inside the wrapper.

If EA app says "Game update required" after using Sims 4 Updater, but trying to update
doesn't do anything - repair your game in EA app instead: open the game page, click
"Manage" and then "Repair". If trying to repair your game doesn't do anything either
- reboot your computer and try again. If that still doesn't do anything - disable
automatic game updates in EA app settings and reboot your computer one more time.
This is an issue with file permissions.
Only people with legit DLCs are affected. But don't worry, this should happen only once,
when you run Sims 4 Updater for the first time and it shows a message about
missing DLC files. It will happen again if you buy a DLC or click
the "Repair" button in Sims 4 Updater, keep that in mind too.

When running the Updater your root directory is available as a Z: drive.
When browsing for folder you access it by opening "My Computer".
External drives are mounted in /Volumes, so they should be in Z:\Volumes.


If you have a legit game and Updater can't move the files to The Sims 4 Packs folder
or can't create folders in there - run this script:
